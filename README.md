# License Selection (Week 7 – Git Advanced 1)

For this Week 7 repository, I selected the **MIT License**.

This repository contains exercises related to advanced Git concepts such as
branching, merging, resolving conflicts, and working with more complex version
control workflows.  
Since the repository mainly includes educational examples and practice files,
there is no proprietary or sensitive content that requires restrictive
protection.  

The MIT License is appropriate because it is simple, permissive, and widely
adopted in open-source development. It allows others to freely reuse the Git
examples, learn from the commit history, and modify the material as needed while
still preserving the author's copyright notice.  
This makes MIT the most suitable choice for a learning-focused repository like
this one.
